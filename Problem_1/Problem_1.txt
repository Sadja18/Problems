Problem Statement:
Consider two lists having equal number of are provided: list_a and list_b

Augment list_b to match index changes of items of list_b with index changes of items when list_a is sorted.

Sample Input:
list_a : [ 2, 1, 4, 3]
list_b : [a, b, d, c]

Expected Output:
list_b = [b, a, c, d]

Explanation:
When list_a is sorted, following index changes occur:
1 goes from index 1 to index 0,
2 goes from index 0 to index 1,
3 goes from index 3 to index 2,
4 goes from index 2 to index 3.

Therefore, items of list_b will changed as follows:
item(list_b) at index 1 will be placed at index 0,
item(list_b) at index 0 will be placed at index 1,
item(list_b) at index 3 will be placed at index 2,
item(list_b) at index 2 will be placed at index 3.
