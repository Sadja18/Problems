# Helper

Many companies who hire software developers shortlist candidates based on a coding skill assessment round. Usually (espcially for beginners), these technical rounds require the candidates to write programs to solve few tasks, namely, number patterns, string patterns, etc.
These basic problems seem hard to solve, however, almost every problem has a solution.

This repository is focused to provide an idea to the coders/script-kiddies about the algorithm behind the solutions to these problems.

The vision is to cover as many different types of problem statements as possible.

#### In case you are stuck on the following:
 * What is GitHub?
 * How to use GitHub?
 * Basics of Python/ OOPs/ Programing.
 * How to install Python (the programing language used in these solutions).
 * How to run these programs?
 * Have a different problem statement!
 * Facing errors while trying to run my solutions!
Feel free to contact me on my website, https://sadja.pythonanywhere.com

Also, if you have a better solutions for any of the problem statements mentioned here, feel free to contact me about that and I will make sure that your version of the solution is posted along with credit of you; however; I encourage you to not copy and paste solutions mentioned on tutorial websites.
