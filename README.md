Many companies who hire software developers shortlist candidates based on a coding skill assessment round. Usually (espcially for beginners), these technical rounds require the candidates to write programs to solve few tasks, namely, number patterns, string patterns, etc.
These basic problems seem hard to solve, however, almost every problem has a solution.

This repository is focused to provide an idea to the coders/script-kiddies about the algorithm behind the solutions to these codes

The vision is to cover as many different types of problem statements as possible. 
If you are having trouble with some programming assignment or you are stuck on problem statement, raise a query on my website https://sadja.pythonanywhere.com and a solution for that problem will be posted as soon as possible.

Also, if you have a better solutions for any of the problem statements mentioned here, feel free to contact me about that and I will make sure that your version of the solution is posted along with credit of you; however; I encourage you to not copy and paste solutions mentioned on tutorial websites.
